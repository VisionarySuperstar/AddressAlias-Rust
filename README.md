# Address Alias

Create an alias for your address.
* Search an address by alias: "batman" => "secret12345678901234567890"
* Search an alias by address: "secret12345678901234567890" => "batman"

## Concept / Why

* Easy way to find and share addresses.
* Easy way to let people know the purpose of an address. e.g. "btn.group - admin 1"

### Use case examples

1. Finding and sharing an address through btn.group's site
* Batman asks Bane to send him 3 scrt tokens.
* Batman tells Bane that he can grab his wallet address from [btn.group](https://www.btn.group/secret_network/address_alias) by searching for 'thedarkknight'.
* Bane goes to website, searches for 'thedarkknight' and retrieves the wallet address.

2. Finding and sharing an address via a third party app
* Bane asks the league of shadows to send him 333 tokens.
* The league of shadows is using an app which has incorporated this contract.
* Bane tells the league of shadows that his alias is 'breakyou'.
* The league of shadows enters the alias into the app and it auto fills the wallet adddress to send to.

3. Easier auditing
* Robin wants to audit an instance of a smart contract before investing.
* Robin sees a few different addresses interacting with it.
* He looks up an address in a flash and gets a better picture of what's going on.
